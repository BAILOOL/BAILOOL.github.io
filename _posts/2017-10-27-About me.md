---

I am a M.S. graduate of Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) [laboratory](http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST advised by [Prof. In So Kweon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XA8EOlEAAAAJ&hl=en). I have received Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST. During undergrad, I have worked on several research projects with [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFhLmFkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Daniel Saakes](http://mid.kaist.ac.kr/people/). Currently, I am working in [NOUL](https://noul.kr/), developing artificial intelligence for a medical image analysis.


Research interests:

* Microscopy diagnosis of malaria
* Complete Blood Count (CBC)
* Object detection, recognition (e.g. road markings, lanes)
* Cooperative SLAM
