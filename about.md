Currently, I am working at [Kakao Brain](https://kakaobrain.com/) focusing on human pose estimation and action similarity.

I am a M.S. graduate of Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) [laboratory](http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST advised by [Prof. In So Kweon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XA8EOlEAAAAJ&hl=en). I have received Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST. During undergrad, I have worked on several research projects with [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFhLmFkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Daniel Saakes](http://mid.kaist.ac.kr/people/).

Topics I have worked on so far:
 * Microscopy diagnosis of malaria: segmentation, classification
 * Complete Blood Count (CBC): object detection
 * Medical image synthesis with GANs
 * Road markings and lane recognition
 * Cooperative SLAM
